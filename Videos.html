									<p>Creating a virtual machine can be a great tool when it comes to your computer. With a virtual machine, you can safely run test trials for programs without damaging or effecting the main OS. It also gives you the chance to run a different OS without getting rid of the base OS. Lastly, it gives you a way of keeping all of your files together because other users can use the virtual machine to browse the internet and store files. </p>

								<p>This lesson plan is designed to cater to verbal and visual learning styles to keep students engaged in the lesson; with the use of video via PowToon. PowToon is “interactive software” that allows its users to virtually engage in the lesson through animations. The video will start off with a basic lesson, illustrated on screen. The examples following the lesson will include demonstrations, using people and/or objects representing the prepositions, prepositional phrases, and punctuation (people grammar) in picture form.

									<p>There are many reasons it is crucially important to know the basics of trouble shooting. Trouble shooting will and probably most likely occur in your life time. Trial and Error will come into play when finding a solution to your problem. Sometimes it can be as simple as restarting the computer in order to fix the problem. While other times, it may be a bit more difficult and take different approaches in order to solve the problem. Some of the first steps you should take in order to successfully trouble shoot is, write down the steps you take, check to see if the cables are plugged in, restart the computer, and also, address any error messages.

								<p>An elevator pitch is important because it is a subtle way to introduce yourself while providing brief background knowledge of yourself. It is very simple and straight to the point, but very necessary no matter what field you’re in. This video will show a good and bad example of an elevator pitch. Also, it will explain how to create an elevator pitch.
